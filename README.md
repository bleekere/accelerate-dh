# Accelerate DH Education

Website for the DH2019 workshop "Accelerating DH Education”.

## Description

The workshop offers a platform for communication between DH practitioners, specialists in educational sciences and digital innovation strategists. Its organisers are connected to several Dutch universities and research institutions as well as to nationwide initiatives [SURF](https://surf.nl/) (the collaborative ICT organisation for Dutch education and research), the Netherlands Association of Universities of Applied Sciences ([VH](https://www.vereniginghogescholen.nl/english)) and the the Association of Universities in the Netherlands ([VSNU](https://vsnu.nl/en_GB/)) that together in 2018 initiated the national “[Acceleration plan educational innovation with ICT](https://www.thedigitalsociety.info/acceleration-plan-for-innovation-in-education-with-ict/)”. This combination of DH experts and educational specialists presents a unique opportunity to consider a shared strategic agenda for innovation in DH education. The outcome of this workshop is primarily one of community building, whereby DH practitioners interested in pedagogy can discuss ways to move forward in the near future and to potentially consider the idea of composing a shared strategic agenda on this topic.

## Format
This workshop will take place over a half-day on the morning of Monday 8 July and will include several sessions devoted to a theme or topic relevant to DH pedagogy and education. Each session will begin with presentations followed by discussions. The final session will be a summative discussion with a focus on future strategies. Participants are invited to submit in advance a 5 to 10 minute lightning talk relating to one of the topics described below, or propose another topic in an area in which they have experience or expertise:


1. **DH Pedagogy in practice**  
We take stock of existing types of DH educational resources, course materials, and pedagogical approaches. This entails, among others, the question of how DH practitioners develop their skill sets and on the resources that are available to them. Furthermore, how can we identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current status quo, and evaluate the effectiveness of teaching?

1. **Open education**  
Open Education (OE) can be defined in multiple ways; we zoom in on the aspects that could be of relevance to Digital Humanities education. We set ou to map and discuss the implications for accessible, inclusive and sustainable approaches of open education initiatives, such as MOOCs and the [#dariahTeach](https://teach.dariah.eu/) platform. 

2. **Shared educational agendas and initiatives**  
How can we move towards more cooperative and evidence-based approaches to teaching and training in DH across the community? What are the key desiderata for educational innovation in DH? How can national agendas and international initiatives best be employed?


## Submission

We welcome 200-300 word proposals from anyone involved or interested in the creation and usage of educational resources in DH.
