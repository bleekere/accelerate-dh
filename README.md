# Accelerate DH Education

## Description

The workshop offers an exceptional platform for communication between DH practitioners, specialists in educational sciences and digital innovation strategists. 

Among its organisers are people connected to several Dutch universities and research institutions alongside nationwide initiatives [SURF](https://surf.nl) (the collaborative ICT organisation for Dutch education and research), the Netherlands Association of Universities of Applied Sciences ([VH](https://www.vereniginghogescholen.nl/english)) and the the Association of Universities in the Netherlands ([VSNU](https://vsnu.nl/en_GB/)) that together in 2018 initiated the national plan "[Acceleration plan educational innovation with ICT](https://www.thedigitalsociety.info/acceleration-plan-for-innovation-in-education-with-ict/)". 

This combination of DH experts and educational specialists presents a unique opportunity to consider a shared strategic agenda for innovation in DH education. 

The workshop is organized primarily around two strands of discussion: 

1. Open Education
Open Education can be defined in multiple ways, we will zoom in on the aspects that could be of relevance to Digital Humanities education, and to map and imagine its implications for accessible, inclusive and sustainable approaches to its delivery. 

2. Shared educational agendas and initiatives
How can we move towards more cooperative and evidence-based approaches to teaching and training in DH across the community? What are the key desiderata for educational innovation in DH? This strand will feature both national agendas and international initiatives including the #dariahTeach platform.
